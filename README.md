# Usage
  The game can be played here: [Slice the Pie](https://slice-the-pie.glitch.me/).  First, the user fills out their guesses for revenues, clicks next, and fills out their guesses for expenses. Then, they can continue on to see their guesses compared to the true value. 
  
 # Features
 - The game stores information, so the user can go back to previous tabs. The game also allows for a reset, to let the player start anew.
 - The progress bar on the top tracks what step the user is on.
 - For the input, the information tooltips give explanations for the sections when hovered over.  The total automatically sums up the inputs, and if the total becomes greater than 100%, the last input will be brought down to compensate.
